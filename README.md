# Hell Mail
The player takes the role of a damned spirit who, in hopes of lessening their sentence in hell, was hired by the Grim Reaper to man the Purgatory Post Office, which handles the communications between Heaven and Hell. You are responsible for making sure that no nefarious mail or packages makes it to either side. Your job is to sort the letters that come through the office into their appropriate mailboxes. 

As the game progresses, the packages will move along the conveyer belt faster and will be progressively more difficult. Correctly completed tasks will earn you points, while missed tasks take away points. If you meet the required point quota, you will move on to the next level and lessen your time in hell.
