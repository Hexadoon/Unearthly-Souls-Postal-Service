# U.S.P.S: Unearthly Souls Postal Service
The player takes the role of a damned spirit who, in hopes of lessening their sentence in hell, was hired by the Grim Reaper to man the Purgatory Post Office, which handles the communications between Heaven and Hell. You are responsible for making sure that no nefarious mail or packages makes it to either side. Your job is to sort the letters that come through the office into their appropriate mailboxes. 

As the game progresses, the packages will move along the conveyor belt faster and will be progressively more difficult. Correctly completed tasks will earn you points, while missed tasks take away points. If you meet the required point quota, you will move on to the next level and lessen your time in hell.

## How to Play

The goal of this game is to reach a certain number of points before the clock runs out by correctly sorting mail. Each correctly sorted package is worth 10 points; each wrongly sorted or missed package deducts 5 points.

There are two things to check on each letter or package: the location address and its symbol. It’s your job to make sure each parcel has a valid postal address on it. The list of correct addresses, and their coordinating symbol, can be found on the cream poster on the wall.

But be wary! Some letters and packages might have incorrect labels on them! Make sure to check that each label has a valid shipping address before you sort into the mail system, or you’ll lose points for every wrong package.

Packages also must be searched for contraband! Use your X-Ray goggles in the Tool Bar to search each package and make sure they don’t contain any of the banned items found on the red poster on the wall.

Rejected parcels (either with incorrect addresses or containing contraband) must be stamped with the Rejection Stamp and sent through the Rejection Chute for destruction!

# Controls

CLICK on a letter or package to drag it around the screen. To bring a letter or package closer in order to read its label, DOUBLE CLICK on it.

To sort a letter or package, CLICK and DRAG the package to its destination and HOVER over it. The letter or package will enter the correct receptacle, and, if sorted correctly, will award you points. Each location is notated by its location symbol, so be sure to send your parcel to the right location!

To use a tool from the Tool Bar, either CLICK and DRAG the tool onto the letter or package to use it (Rejection Stamp, X-Ray Goggles) or simply CLICK on it (Punch Card).

CLICK on the Posters at any time to view information on valid location addresses, banned items, and safe items.

# Tools

The Rejection Stamp: Each wrongly addressed or contraband parcel must be rejected before it can be destroyed. CLICK and DRAG the Rejection Stamp onto the mail, then send it off through the Rejection Chute.

The X-Ray Goggles: The X-Ray Goggles are your friend for searching suspicious packages without having to actually open them! Simply CLICK and DRAG the Goggles over the package, and peer inside. Be sure to check the CONTRABAND and ALLOWED ITEMS posters on the wall to make sure each item in the box is safe. If they’re not, then reject it! 

The Punch Card: Use your Punch Card to pause the game whenever you like, restart the game, or check the general controls again.
